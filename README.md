# Turtle_Hot_Cold-Python-Project
    Using the Pygame library, we will be remaking the Turtle code for Hot Cold 
    and remastering it using Pycharm and Pygame. We also took the liberty to
    "Spice Up" the game by making it a game where you play as a Rock that
    turns into "The Rock" as you get closer to the hidden circle.

# The User will be able to do the following:
    1. Start up the game with a User interface and 3 difficulties
    2. Interact in the environment as Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson
    3. Engage with the world in a search for a hidden blue circle
    4. Detect whether you are closer or further from the circle with the Hot/Cold indicator
    5. Record records of time and see the pixels traveled
